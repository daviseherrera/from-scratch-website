    <h1 class="center fonthead">A Supplementary Guide for Runners</h1>

    <p class="justify">Running, celebrated for its simplicity and significant health benefits, stands as one of the most popular forms of physical exercise globally. Its accessibility is a key factor in its widespread popularity; requiring minimal equipment, primarily a pair of good running shoes, it can be undertaken in a variety of settings, from urban streets to serene nature trails. The health benefits of running are extensive, offering an efficient means to enhance cardiovascular health, aid in weight management, and improve mental well-being by reducing stress and anxiety. Additionally, running can be a highly social activity, with clubs and events fostering a sense of community and shared purpose.</p>
        <p class="justify">The popularity of running is reflected in the millions of people who participate in it worldwide, from casual joggers to professional athletes. Events like marathons and fun runs attract vast numbers of participants, highlighting running's appeal across a diverse demographic.</p>
        <p class="justify">A crucial aspect of any running regimen, often overlooked by beginners, is the inclusion of stretching and strength training. Stretching, particularly dynamic stretching before runs and static stretching afterwards, is important for maintaining flexibility and reducing the risk of injuries. Strength training, on the other hand, bolsters muscles and joints, thereby enhancing running performance and further decreasing injury risks. This balanced approach to running ensures a safer and more effective practice, allowing runners to enjoy the sport's benefits sustainably.</p>
        <p class="justify">There are many wonderful sources that can give a great running plan for all kinds of races or training styles. This website is not one of those. This website will focus on providing a well-rounded supplementary guide for runners. It will include a stregnth plan and a stretch plan with videos to explain and demonstrate. We hope you enjoy!</p>
